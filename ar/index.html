                                <p>Augmented Reality, or AR, is a technology that combines real-life surroundings with digitally generated content. The generated content is usually designed to improve the viewer's conception of their surroundings by providing supplementary information about the surroundings. Augmented Reality changes in real time, and updates its information with every change of view or setting. AR technology adapts to all perspectives of reality, through all points of view, while normal graphics generated on the computer or TV only adapt to one angle and one situation. 
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Augmented Reality (AR) is usually confused with Virtual Reality (VR). VR completely immerses the user in a world different than reality, while AR imposes digital content on reality.

                            The main benefit of Augmented Reality is that it further improves our perception and understanding of the world around us. From entertainment to medical to military uses, AR brings us useful information that is relevant to the present, updated in real time. Information that one would normally need to consult others or search the internet to find would be available in plain view and would complement reality in an effective and useful manner

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                While Augmented Reality greatly enhances the quality of technology in a range of fields, it also has a downside. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Firstly, the fascination of new AR technology can often become a distraction to users, especially kids and teenagers. This is especially prevalent in recreational AR uses, such as Snapchat filters or Pokemon GO. Users often become immersed in the modified reality, as it can be more advanced and interesting than normal reality. This can lead to decreased interaction with the outside world. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Additionally, certain health issues can be traced back to overuse of AR. Prolonged use of the technology can lead to eye and head aches, as is the same with overuse of any screen based technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Access of digital modifiers to cameras or any other view of reality can also lead to hacks in data and decreases in privacy. If someone hacks into an AR program, he or she can get access to camera content also.
                            </p>

                            Augmented Reality development kits are currently on the market. Using these kits, businesses can develop applications for Augmented Reality and sell them to other AR users. These apps have a wide range of uses and usually manipulate different sets of real data
                            </p>

                            An example of this would be the Meta AR Development Kit, which includes a headset on which developers can build and use AR apps.

                            Heads Up Display is a commonly used display that is cast onto the windshield of fighter planes and displays information such as altitude and airspeed. This is so that the pilot can look straight ahead and see everything needed for reaching destinations and/or attacks.

                            Head Mounted Display is a display cast on a wearable platform that is used by ground troops so they can see enemy location and other statistics.

                            <p>
                            Augmented reality has many recreational uses in video games and social media. These uses highly increased the number of users of AR, and broadened the age range of users to include kids and teenagers as well.
                            Augmented Reality is also used in the popular mobile game Pokémon GO. In this game, the regular camera of the user’s phone is used to view surroundings, and different digital creatures are overlayed onto the camera view. The user has to walk around and “capture” these creatures. The game uses AR to overlay creatures onto the camera view and to manipulate these creatures with every change of reality.
                            </p>
                            <img class="mdl-card" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7725/28286906571_813c6e6d82_b.jpg">
                            <p>
                            Augmented Reality is also used in the popular social media platform Snapchat. The camera features “lenses” that use facial recognition software to overlay and modify different facial features on the user’s face. These lenses also add different particle effects in the user’s background. The facial overlays can change depending on the position of the user’s eyebrows or the shape of their mouth. 
                            </p>

                            A new AR technology is the windshield GPS, where navigation and speed content is displayed directly on the windshield in plain view of the driver. This avoids distractions, as the driver no longer has to alternate between viewing the GPS and the windshield.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                            In this digital age, technological advancements are happening more and more often, and are becoming more and more integrated into daily life. With these advancements, Augmented Reality has an increasingly large number of potential uses. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            For example, retails stores can potentially have AR catalogs, which show availability of items in a section of the store as the user walks into the store. Similar to how store websites show the availability of products online, AR catalogs will show availability of any product as the user walks into a store. The user can also potentially look at a product through an AR headset and instantly see reviews and pricing information about the product. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Another example of a potential AR use would be an AR telescope for commercial use. With this product, the user can look through a telescope and instantly see information about any spotted object. This would require the telescope to be able to instantly recognize different bodies in space and present information on them. The AR function could potentially become so common that these telescopes can be produced for retail.
